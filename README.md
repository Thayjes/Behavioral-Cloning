# Behavioral Cloning Project

## Introduction
This is the third project of term 1 of Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program. The aim of the project is to train a model to autonomously steer the car around a track. This is achieved by building a convolutional neural network in Keras which predicts steering angles from images.
